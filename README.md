# VF5US_FightersJournal
Repo for VF5US Fighter's Journal

## Temporary description (more to come)

This app is something I've developing for Virtua Fighter enthusiasts like myself. My initial plan for it is to basically be a practice-log/note-taking app so players can track their progress with a particular character in Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown. Once I get that basic functionality in place I'll look into adding other features. Some possibilities I have in mind are movelists with frame-data, offline PWA functionality, etc. Down the line I might even expand to other fighting games (or maybe similar apps for particular games just to keep each app uncluttered).

This is in no way expected to be a substitute for the vast info that sites like https://virtuafighter.com/ have made available over the years, but my hope is that I can develop it into a supplement to such resources that players will find useful in it's own right. I've been spectating fighting games for years now, and I look forward to contributing something myself to the FGC. I think the return of VF is as good a time as any for that.
